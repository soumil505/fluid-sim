# Fluid Sim
A fluid simulation plus particle physics simulation in processing that applies physics to particles in 2d and uses the motion of these particles to simulate fluid flow.

Adapted from Daniel Shiffman's (https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/132-fluid-simulation.html) tutorial on fluid dynamics which in turn is based on Jos Stams Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games (http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf)
